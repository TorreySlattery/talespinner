Talespinner is a personal project that aims to help me accomplish two goals:
  
- Easily generate basic 2D maps to use while DMing my games
- Eventually provide a resource that my players can view as we play so that I can call up on the fly

The current plan is to have the project broken into the following sections:
  
- The Bestiary app keeps track of creatures and any vital statistics to create searchable, scalable encounters
- The Mapgen app builds the actual terrain via various algorithms
- The Display app provides the actual Views and Templates needed to render the game world
